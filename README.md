# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for Image Generation

## Dataset Preprocessing
1. **Load Dataset:**
   - Ensure that the dataset contains images in a structured format.
   - Use TensorFlow's dataset pipeline or load images using OpenCV/PIL.

2. **Resizing and Normalization:**
   - Resize images to a uniform shape (e.g., 64x64, 128x128).
   - Normalize pixel values to range [-1, 1] for stable training:
     ```python
     dataset = dataset.map(lambda x: (tf.cast(x, tf.float32) - 127.5) / 127.5)
     ```

3. **Batching and Shuffling:**
   - Set batch size (e.g., `BATCH_SIZE = 32`).
   - Shuffle the dataset to improve training stability:
     ```python
     dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=10000).batch(BATCH_SIZE)
     ```

## Training the Model
1. **Define Hyperparameters:**
   - Set learning rates, batch size, label smoothing, etc.

2. **Initialize Models:**
   - Define both generator and discriminator networks.
   - Initialize optimizers (Adam optimizer recommended).

3. **Training Loop:**
   - For each epoch:
     - Generate fake images from random noise.
     - Compute loss for generator and discriminator.
     - Update model weights using gradients.

4. **Saving Checkpoints:**
   - Save model weights at regular intervals:
     ```python
     ckpt_manager.save()
     ```

5. **Run Training:**
   - Execute training script:
     ```python
     train(train_ds, EPOCHS)
     ```

---

## Testing the Model
1. **Generate Images:**
   - Use trained generator to create images from noise:
     ```python
     generate_images(seed_noise)
     ```
   - Saves generated images as PNG files.

2. **Evaluate Losses:**
   - Print final generator and discriminator losses:
     ```python
     print(f'Final Generator Loss: {gen_mean_loss.result()}')
     print(f'Final Discriminator Loss: {disc_mean_loss.result()}')
     ```

---

## Expected Output
- Generated images improve over training epochs.
- Loss values stabilize over time, indicating convergence.
- Final generated images should resemble dataset samples.

---

## Notes
- Ensure proper GPU acceleration for faster training.
- If training is unstable, adjust hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size).
- Use more epochs for better results.
